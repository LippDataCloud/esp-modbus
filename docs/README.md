# ESP-Modbus Library

This folder represents the official documentation for ESP-Modbus library (**esp-modbus component documentation**).
The library supports Modbus communication in the networks based on RS485 or Ethernet interfaces.
The Modbus is a data communications protocol originally published by Modicon (now Schneider Electric) in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs).
The Modbus has become a de facto standard communication protocol and is now a commonly available means of connecting industrial electronic devices.
